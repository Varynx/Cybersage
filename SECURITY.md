## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

As this is more of a privat project, it will not be expected for people to share vurnerabilites to us. But in case there is one, you can reach out to us via email.
bloopfisch@gmail.com , or you can post on https://www.reddit.com/r/Cybersage/hot/

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

There wont really be updates regarding reported vurnerabilities unless we feel like it.
